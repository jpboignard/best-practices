## Description

Regularly maintaining your website is essential not only to ensure its proper functioning and improve the user experience, but also to reduce its environmental footprint. Over time, the content and features of your website accumulate, and the risk of displaying and storing useless, outdated, or even counterproductive information increases.

This poor practice is problematic on several levels because it can:

* Cause poor SEO
* Give a poor image
* Slow down loading times and degrade the user experience
* Lose visitors by displaying a lot of useless/outdated information
* Unnecessarily consume resources storing unused data
* Create incompatibilities with other tools installed on your site
* Be a source of cyberattacks.

## Example

If using a CMS :

* Update the CMS and its extensions to reduce security issues.

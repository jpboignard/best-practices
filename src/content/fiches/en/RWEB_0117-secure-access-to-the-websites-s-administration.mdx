## Description

When using widely known CMS, the access path to site administration is often identical from one site to another.

As a result, brute force attacks are very common and these attacks have a significant impact on the network and infrastructure.

Attacks are even more successful when a user's login is predictable or when passwords are not strong enough.

## Exemple

WordPress, one of the most widely used CMSs on the market, offers its administration via the URL: /wp-admin or [/wp-login.php.](/wp-login.php.) Joomla uses [/administrator,](/administrator,) for Kirby, it's [/panel,](/panel,) etc.

It is possible to change this address to limit attacks, for instance with:

* a random string without capital letters: /ze62ane96, /o6\\\_jhej639, [/dj5zjaih2-ep8e](/dj5zjaih2-ep8e)
* one or more words related to your activity: /build, /play, [/prepare-the-menu](/prepare-the-menu)
* or a combination of both: /play\\\_562fg6

Do not use "admin," "website domain name," or "first or last name of the company director" as your username.

A secure password must contain at least 8 characters, including lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
